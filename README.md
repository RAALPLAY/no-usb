# NO-USB: Share files PC

NO-USB is an excellent application to navigate and transfer files between the mobile device and the PC, as if it were a USB cable, through a local Wi-Fi connection.

The application works as an FTP server where all your files will be hosted on the network, allowing only access to the scanned computer and automating the connection process in a single click.
